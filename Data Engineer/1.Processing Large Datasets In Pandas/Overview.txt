In the last course, we covered the idea of memory limitations, and figured out some strategies to overcome them with Pandas. As a quick refresher, a memory limitation is when a dataset won't fit into the memory available on your computer. When this happens, you need to rely on workarounds, like processing the data in batches that do fit into memory, or relying on tools, like SQLite, that keep the data on disk instead of in memory while doing processing.
